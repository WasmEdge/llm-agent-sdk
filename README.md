# WasmEdge-LLM-Agent-Sdk

WebAssembly runtimes, such as the open source WasmEdge runtime, are very well suited for running lightweight serverless functions. A particularly useful use case is Wasm functions that act as serverless extensions for LLMs (Large Language Models, such as ChatGPT).

The primary objectives of this project is to create a software framework with built-in support for:

- Accessing popular cloud LLM services

- Accessing locally trained LLM instances

- Fine-tuning LLMs

- Segmenting documents and generating embeddings from the LLMs

- Managing vector database for the embeddings

- Managing prompt libraries

- Interfacing with external systems through the WasmEdge connectors SDK

Since this project is to add an SDK for WasmEdge, the contribution should be located in the [WasmEdge/llm-agent-sdk repo](https://github.com/WasmEdge/llm-agent-sdk).


## This project is also a part of [OSPP'23](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/org/prodetail/238830548?list=org&navpage=org)

Open Source Promotion Plan is a summer program organized by the Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences and long-term supported by the Open Source Software Supply Chain Promotion Plan. It aims to encourage college students to actively participate in the maintenance and development of open source software, promote the vigorous development of open source software communities, and build the open source software supply chain together.

## What will happen/you do in this program?

The student intern for this project will work with the WasmEdge team to build a Rust and JavaScript based framework, similiar to ChatGPT plugins and LangChain, that supports common automation and extension tasks around LLMs.
